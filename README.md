### Microsoft Azure Hardware Systems & Infrastructure  
**_Manufacturing Engineer II (March 2019 - Present)_**  
_| Azure ML Studio | Azure Data Studio | SQL | Kusto | Python | Quantum XL |_  
- Led cross-functional development of Power BI forecasting tool to optimize workload distribution of **400+** hardware SKU programs across **7** engineering teams.
- Leveraged SQL and Python to extract, clean, and model program development timelines, improving development schedule forecasting accuracy by **20%** 
- Led design and implementation of chassis sheet metal DOE and factory process control reviews which unblocked supplier server production and saved **$8 million** in deployment delay costs.
- Created datacenter repair ticket prioritization model to optimize server repair operations by highlighting tickets with the shortest repair time and longest mean time to repair [Hackathon].


## <ins> Projects </ins>
### 1) DJ Music Collection Segmentation  
_| Python | Unsupervised Learning | Spotify API |_  
- Analyzed DJ music collection of **2,700** tracks using features (e.g. tempo, key, runtime) as well as queried attributes from Spotify's API  (e.g. instrumentalness, danceability, energy).
- Segmented tracks into clusters via K-Means and K-Medoids algorithms combined with Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
- Utilized novel track groupings to create new setlists and mixes for DJ performances.
