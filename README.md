### DJ Music Collection Segmentation 
_| Python | Unsupervised Learning | Spotify API |_
- Analyzed DJ music collection of **2,700** tracks using features (e.g. tempo, key, runtime) as well as queried attributes from Spotify's API  (e.g. instrumentalness, danceability, energy).
- Segmented tracks into clusters via K-Means and K-Medoids algorithms combined with Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
- Utilized novel track groupings to create new setlists and mixes for DJ performances.
